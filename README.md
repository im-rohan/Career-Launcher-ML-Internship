# Career-Launcher-ML-Internship
This internship is endorsed and co-certified by AICTE for all technical colleges in India. IntelÂ® is the software and hardware partner.

## Programming Tools and Languages
Python and machine learning libraries from Scikit-Learn (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc). Machine learning algorithms for Regression and Classification are implemented too.

## Modules covered
The modules covered in the Machine Learning Internship can be thought of as Machine Learning Projects with a set objective that the participant has to complete every week. These Machine Learning projects require the participant to study on the relevant topics and practically apply it to solve each problem. Solving these problems will allow the participant to complete the module and move on to the next module and Machine Learning Project.
### Module 1 - Data Exploration Using Pandas
### Module 2 - Plotting in Financial Markets
### Module 3 - Regression - Beta Calculation
### Module 4 - Algo Trading using Classification
### Module 5 - Modern Portfolio Theory
### Module 6 - Clustering for Diverse portfolio analysis
